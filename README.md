## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** (or swipe gestures on touch devices) to move the tiles.
- When two tiles with the same number collide, they **merge into one** with their values added together.
- The goal is to create a tile with the value **2048**.
- The game ends when there are no valid moves left.

## üöÄ Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Animations**: Tiles move and merge with smooth transitions.
- **Keyboard and Touch Support**: Play using arrow keys or by clicking controls.
- **Dynamic Tile Sizing**: Tile sizes and grid gaps are calculated dynamically based on the screen size, with a maximum tile size of 75px.
- **Throttled Input**: User inputs are throttled to prevent overlapping moves.
- **Game State Management**: The game state is managed using Redux Toolkit, ensuring predictable behavior.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: The game is deployed and accessible via [GitHub Pages](https://prikhoda-natalia.github.io/2048-game-reactjs).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
